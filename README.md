### Adventure Works Data Warehouse project (Sales data mart).




### Overview
The AdventureWorks2019 Sales Data Mart Project is a powerful data solution built on SQL Server and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and powerpi.
It efficiently extracts, transforms, and loads data from SQL Server into a star schema-based data model.

### Data Sources
The AdventureWorks2019 dataset serves as the main source of data for the AdventureWorks2019 Sales Data Mart Project. 
This dataset offers extensive data about sales, clients, goods, and other topics. AdventureWorks (2019)

### Prerequisites
Before getting started with the proejct, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

SQL Server
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
PowerPi

#### Data Modeling (Star Schema)
The project employs a star schema for streamlined analytics:

- Fact Sales: Centralizes key sales measures.
- Dim Product: Manages product details.
- Dim Customer: Comprehensive customer information.
- Dim Date: Time-related data for analysis.
- Dim Territory: Stores territory details.

### ETL
- The ETL process is comprised of 3 steps that enable data integration from source to destination: data extraction, data transformation, and data loading.

## 1. Dimension Product
- Dim Product design extract customer data from the source database (OLEDB). Apply some transformation (Lookup and get data from different tables and replace Nulls values).

- Apply Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) processing to handle orders changes.

## 2. Dimension Customer
- Dim customer design extract customer data from the source database (OLEDB). Apply some transformation (Lookup and get data from different tables and replace Nulls values).

- Apply Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) processing to handle customer phone changes.

## 3. Dim Date 
- Design extract customer data from the source database Excel file.
- Apply data convesion to Month_name column to reduce its length.
