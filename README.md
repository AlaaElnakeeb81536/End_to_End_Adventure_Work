### Adventure Works Data Warehouse project (Sales data mart).




### Overview
The AdventureWorks2019 Sales Data Mart Project is a powerful data solution built on SQL Server and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and powerpi.
It efficiently extracts, transforms, and loads data from SQL Server into a star schema-based data model.

### Data Mart
A data mart is an organized subset of a data warehouse that is targeted at a particular department or functional area inside a company.
It offers a focused and streamlined perspective of the data, meeting particular reporting and analytical requirements. Smaller in size and breadth, 
data marts usually contain pertinent information for a particular user group, such finance, sales, or marketing. They are arranged according to particular topics, 
like sales, customer information, or product details, and they are optimized, converted, and formatted for effective domain querying and analysis.

### Data Sources
The AdventureWorks2019 dataset serves as the main source of data for the AdventureWorks2019 Sales Data Mart Project. 
This dataset offers extensive data about sales, clients, goods, and other topics. AdventureWorks (2019)

### ETL
- The ETL process is comprised of 3 steps that enable data integration from source to destination: data extraction, data transformation, and data loading.

## 1. Dimension Product
- Dim Product design extract customer data from the source database (OLEDB). Apply some transformation (Lookup and get data from different tables and replace Nulls values).

- Apply Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) processing to handle orders changes.

some insights derived from the Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard:

**1. Profit Distribution**

Accessories dominate the profit landscape with a total of $438.67M, significantly higher than other categories like Bikes and Clothing.
Within Accessories, Tires and Tubes and Helmets are the top-performing subcategories, contributing $153.7M and $141.06M, respectively.

**2. Product-Level Performance**

HL Mountain Tire leads in profit among individual products, generating $30.59M.
The ML Mountain Tire and HL Road Tire follow, with $21.8M and $17.51M in profits, respectively.
This indicates that mountain and road tires are crucial to the overall profitability of the company.

**3. Sales Target Achievement**

The dashboard shows that the actual sales ($29.36M) are slightly below the monthly target of $32.24M, indicating a shortfall of about $2.88M. This suggests a need to explore strategies to boost sales.
On the profit side, the company is closer to its target, with actual profits of $11.69M against a target of $12.83M. While there is a gap, it is smaller than the sales shortfall, indicating relatively better control over costs or higher profit margins.

**4. Strategic Focus Areas**

Bottles and Cages and Fenders are underperforming subcategories within Accessories, with profits of $35.56M and $29.18M, respectively. These areas may require further attention to enhance profitability.
Clothing as a category shows the lowest profit contribution at $136.41M. This could be an area for either a strategic revamp or reallocation of resources to more profitable categories.

Accessories are the next major contributor, generating $700.76K in sales, though far behind Bikes.
Clothing ranks third with $339.77K in sales, suggesting it is a less significant contributor to overall revenue.

**3. Subcategory Performance**

Within Accessories, Tires and Tubes lead with $245.53K in sales, followed by Helmets at $225.34K.

**5. Potential Growth Opportunities**

Given that the sales are slightly under target, there may be opportunities to boost sales through promotional activities, especially for high-margin and high-volume products like Bikes and Tires.
The Accessories category, while performing reasonably well, shows room for growth, especially in subcategories like Bottles and Cages, and Fenders, which are underperforming relative to their peers.

**6. Focus Areas**

Bikes should continue to be a focal point for sales strategies given their substantial contribution to overall revenue.
There may be potential to enhance sales in the Clothing category, which currently contributes the least among the major categories.
Optimizing inventory and marketing strategies for top-selling products like HL Mountain Tire could help close the gap in sales targets.
